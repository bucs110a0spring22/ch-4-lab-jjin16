_Replace anything surrounded by the `< >` symbols._

## SUMMARY:
 The program draws the sine graph, cosine graph, and tangent graph on the appropriate canvas size.

## GRACE DAYS
Grace days used for this assignment: 0

Grace days remaining: 5/5

## KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS:
 When drawing the tangent graph, the turtle object draws an incomplete tangent graph.

## MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS:
 I have already talked to the lab TA about the tangent graph. Seems like this is the best that the turtle module can do to draw the tangent lines.
