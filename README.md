## SUMMARY:
What did you clean up?:I moved the variables that are repeatedtly defined in a function into the main() and added parameters to all the functions I defined to make functions more reusable.

Summary of function(s) added:
I added functions that together draws a pixel drawing of sans, a character from the video game "Undertale".

Summary of Feature Added:
The program asks the user whether they want to see a drawing of sans or not. Then shows the drawing regardless of their answer, followed by a comment depending on the user's input.
